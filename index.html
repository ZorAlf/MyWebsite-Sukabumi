    <p>
      The city of Sukabumi comes from the Sundanese language. That is Suka-Bumen, 
      according to information considering the air is cool and comfortable, 
      those who come to this area do not want to move again because they like / love Bumen-Bumen or reside in this area.

    </p>

    <p>
      In 1914 the Dutch East Indies Government made Sukabumi City a “Burgerlijk Bestuur” with the status of “Gemeente” on the grounds that there were many Dutch and 
      European plantation owners in the Southern Sukabumi District who had to receive special management and services.
